Data Processing of RNA seq data
# import Pandas 

#The data was processed to find the differential expression of genes among the groups (disease vs control) by using the filter for padjusted with less than and equal to 0.05

#Filter between +2 and -2 for log2Foldchange helps to find the up and down regulated genes

# Scatter plot was made against log2Foldchange on x-axis and padj value on y-axis to find the disturbution of the genes; scatter plot for raw data and filter data helps to find the significant genes
