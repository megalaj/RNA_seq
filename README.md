Data analysis of RNA seq data
# import Pandas 
#The data was processed to find the differential expression of genes (DEG's) among the groups (disease vs control) by using the filter for padjusted with less than and equal to 0.05
# Significant genes were selected based on log2Fold change values and also this helps to find the up and down regulated genes
# Scatter plot was made against log2Foldchange (X-axis) and padj value (y-axis) to find the disturbution of the genes
